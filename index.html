	              Being an avid learner of the interdisciplinary study of economics and management, 
	              I am interested in solving business and economic problems by channelling my theoretical knowledge into practical application. 
	              I also like to work with social entrepreneurship and non-profit organisations by contributing through leadership roles or as part of the support network.
